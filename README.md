## Findings

- Adding iterator support to a class is fairly simple and extremely helpful
- Decorators can be really helpful to add reusable functionality across methods (logging, conversion, etc)
- Dunder methods like eq, lt, gt, bool are super helpful in building a full support on a custom object
- Likely best practice to add some of these to classes because you'll likely need them
